👋 Hi there, I’m @jbtuthill

I hold a Bachelor in Ag Engineering from Iowa State University with much course work done in Universidade Estadual de Campinas. I'm a Graduate Student at ISU in the ABE department, passionate about translating the science of data and decision-making to empower farmers who feed the world and collaborate with energy production industries to facilitate more sustainable decisions environmentally and financially. I am currently pursuing my PhD. Welcome to my GitHub page, where I share repositories related to my academic journey and research articles.

- 🔭 **Current Focus:** I'm currently working on the Iowa Food-Energy-Water Nexus (IFEWs), a multidisciplinary research initiative to understand the intricate connections between food production, energy generation, and water resources in Iowa. My research revolves around leveraging data-driven approaches to help in the decision-making of agricultural practices and enhance energy production methods for a more sustainable future while considering the interdependencies and trade-offs within the food-energy-water system.
- 🌱 **Research Interests:** I'm deeply interested in exploring the intersection of data science, agriculture, and energy production. My research aims to harness data analytics and decision-making tools to improve productivity, efficiency, and sustainability in food and animal production as well as energy demands.
- 📚 **PhD Journey:** Throughout my PhD journey, I'm dedicated to bridging the gap between scientific advancements and practical applications in agriculture and energy production. My research endeavors to provide farmers and energy producers with valuable insights and tools to make informed decisions that benefit both the environment and their bottom line.
- 💻 **GitHub Repositories:** Take a look at the repositories corresponding to each article and project related to my PhD. Feel free to explore and contribute!

- 📝 **Publications:** You can also find my publications below.
- 📫 **Connect with Me:** Interested in collaborating or discussing research? You can reach me via https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliabrittestuthill/.
- 🌟 **Fun Fact:** When I'm not immersed in research, you can often find me experimenting in the kitchen, particularly with Korean and Japanese cuisine—a delightful departure from my Brazilian roots! Additionally, I cherish spending quality time with my family, whether it's enjoying a meal together or engaging in fun activities. I also love supporting my husband's woodworking projects, offering maybe too many ideas. Balancing academia with these fulfilling hobbies brings joy and inspiration to my life.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something interesting here! 😊
